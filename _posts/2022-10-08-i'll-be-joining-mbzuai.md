On **February 1, 2023** I will be joining the [Natural Language Processing Department at MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/), a graduate research university fully dedicated to advancing AI as a global force for good.

I will be looking to hire PhD students and postdocs to work with me on the topics in NLP and applications of AI to education. 
If you are interested in working with me as a PhD student or a postdoc, please get in touch.

As a prospective PhD student, you may also find the [University's webpages](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/) useful.
