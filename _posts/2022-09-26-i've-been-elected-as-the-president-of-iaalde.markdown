I have been elected as the President of the **International Alliance to Advance Learning in the Digital Era** ([IAALDE](https://alliancelss.com)).
IAALDE represents **over 3,000 leading researchers worldwide** who have joined forces to **advance science, practice, and policy** on issues surrounding learning in the context of a digital, technology driven era.
The major goal that we are pursuing is to **increase the visibility and impact** of the research produced by members of the individual societies by providing a mechanism for the societies to collaborate and generate a cohesive picture of important findings related to learning in the digital era that could influence research, educational practices, and policy.

If you represent a society and would like to be an IAALDE member, please check the membership details [here](https://alliancelss.com/#membership).
