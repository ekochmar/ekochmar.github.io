This is the webpage for the [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2022-2023/cm/CM30320.html) course that I'm teaching at the University of Bath this semester (Fall 2022).

**Prerequisites**: The course assumes programming knowledge of Python and some familiarity with Machine Learning algorithms; it does not require any prior knowledge of linguistics or Natural Language Processing.

The course closely follows the material of my new book, "**Getting Started with Natural Language Processing**” (available on [Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-started-with-natural-language-processing?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=author&utm_campaign=book_kochmar_getting_10_1_19) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Started-Natural-Language-Processing/dp/1617296767/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)).
It covers a wide range of topics in NLP and provides you with fundamental knowledge of NLP concepts as well as practical skills. 
By the end of this course, you will be able to build your own NLP application in an end-to-end manner.

# Overview

This is a semester-long course with one 2-hour long lecture per week. 
In addition to lectures, students are provided with detailed handouts and practical programming exercises.

Each week addresses a different NLP application and discusses it in detail, introducing relevant **NLP concepts and techniques**. 
**Applications and topics** covered include, among others:

- Information retrieval
- Information extraction
- Text classification
- Topic modelling
- Word embeddings
- Semantic models

# Week 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing

This week's material will **introduce** you to the field of Natural Language Processing, 
first via overviewing its history and the way the field and its algorithms developed over decades, 
then by presenting and discussing the **most popular NLP applications and techniques** used to tackle NLP tasks, 
and finally by linking the NLP techniques and concepts to other fields and approaches.

In addition, in the course of this week you will make your first practical steps in implementation of an NLP algorithm. 
You will learn how to structure an NLP project from the beginning to end and you will focus on the first crucial step in an NLP application – **tokenization**. 
You will learn why this is challenging and how a tokenizer can be implemented in practice. 
Finally, we will conclude with the remarks on language use and word distribution, 
and observations on the implications this has for NLP algorithms. 
You will also run some **frequency analysis** yourself – such analysis is often an important step in the preliminary data investigation, 
which may inform and help you shape your approach to the specific NLP task you are working on.
