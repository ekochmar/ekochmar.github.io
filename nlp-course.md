This is the webpage for the [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2022-2023/cm/CM30320.html) course that I'm teaching at the University of Bath this semester (Fall 2022).
**Prerequisites**: The course assumes programming knowledge of Python and some familiarity with Machine Learning algorithms; it does not require any prior knowledge of linguistics or Natural Language Processing.
The course closely follows the material of my new book, "Getting Started with Getting Started with Natural Language Processing‚Äù (available on [Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-started-with-natural-language-processing?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=author&utm_campaign=book_kochmar_getting_10_1_19) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Started-Natural-Language-Processing/dp/1617296767/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)).
