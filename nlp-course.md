This is the webpage for the [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2022-2023/cm/CM30320.html) course that I'm teaching at the University of Bath this semester (Fall 2022).

**Prerequisites**: The course assumes programming knowledge of Python and some familiarity with Machine Learning algorithms; it does not require any prior knowledge of linguistics or Natural Language Processing.

The course closely follows the material of my new book, "**Getting Started with Natural Language Processing**‚Äù (available on [Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-started-with-natural-language-processing?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=author&utm_campaign=book_kochmar_getting_10_1_19) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Started-Natural-Language-Processing/dp/1617296767/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)).
It covers a wide range of topics in NLP and provides you with fundamental knowledge of NLP concepts as well as practical skills. 
By the end of this course, you will be able to build your own NLP application in an end-to-end manner.

# Overview

This is a semester-long course with one 2-hour long lecture per week. 
In addition to lectures, students are provided with detailed handouts and practical programming exercises.

Each week addresses a different NLP application and discusses it in detail, introducing relevant NLP concepts and techniques. 
Applications and topics covered include, among others:

- Information retrieval
- Information extraction
- Text classification
- Topic modelling
- Word embeddings
- Semantic models
