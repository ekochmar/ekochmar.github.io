I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Bath, where I am part of the AI research group. 
I conduct research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, natural language processing and intelligent tutoring systems.

Prior to that, I have been working as a post-doctoral researcher at the ALTA (Automated Language Teaching and Assessment) Institute, [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/people/), focusing on the development of educational applications for second language learners. 
My research contributed to the building of [Read & Improve](https://readandimprove.englishlanguageitutoring.com), a readability tool for non-native readers of English. 

I am also a co-founder and the chief scientific officer of [Korbit AI](https://www.korbit.ai), focusing on building an AI-powered dialogue-based tutoring system capable of providing learners with high-quality, interactive and personalized education in STEM subjects. 

I hold a PhD in Natural Language Processing and an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, an MA degree in Computational Linguistics from the University of TÃ¼bingen, and a diploma in Applied Linguistics from St. Petersburg State University. 
I am also the President of the Special Interest Group on Building Educational Applications ([SIGEDU](https://sig-edu.org)) of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the President of the International Alliance to Advance Learning in the Digital Era ([IAALDE](https://alliancelss.com)).
